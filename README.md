# 1. Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project we have use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. 

## Our Goals:
- Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us.
- Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions. (NearMiss Algorithm)
- Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
- Create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
- Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.

## Challenges 
- the most important challenge here is to handle data imbalance. the number of Fraud transection is much less than comparing to Non-fraud transection. In ML, data balancing is crucial because it has a huge impact in model training. In this project, we have implemeted several data balancing method to handle this cahllenges and improve model perfromance.

## Things we have done here:
- Done Exploratory Data Abalysis
  - find relation between data
  - find their distribution and other related statistics
  - etc.
- Done Feature Selection:
  -  t-sne + pca
  -  Anova
- Handele Data Imbalance:
  - Random Undesampling
  - SMOTE
  - Combination of SMOTE + UnderSampling
- Apply  Machine Learning Model:
  - KNN
  - Logistic Regreesion
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Nweural Network
- Evalue Model using
  - matirces such as accuracy,precision etc.
  - Confusion matrices
    
# 2. Personal-Bank-Loan-Classification
To use different classification models to predict the likelihood that a customer will buy a personal loan.

## Problem
- To predict whether a liability customer will buy a personal loan or not.
- Which variables are most significant.
- Which segment of customers should be targeted more.
- Does Age have any impact of customer buying loan?
- Do people with less income borrow loans .?
  
## Objective
- To use different classification models to predict the likelihood that a customer will buy a personal loan.
